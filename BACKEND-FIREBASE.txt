Go into Firebase and login with Google account
Create a project called "react-getting-started"
Go to Realtime Database and Create a Database (leave default region)
Start in Test Mode
This sets up a DB and also an API for requests
Get API URL from DATA tab on the first row

When we call using JS Fetch, we can simply add "https://.../meetups.json" and it will automatically add a "meetups" collection/table
Firebase requires it to have .json at the end
